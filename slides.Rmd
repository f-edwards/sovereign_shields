## John Duane Fairbanks

\begin{scriptsize} \textbf{04/18/2019 Coon Rapids,	MN:} John Duane Fairbanks allegedly pulled a gun during a routine traffic stop and exchanged gunfire with Coon Rapids police about 1:30 a.m. After fleeing on foot and shooting at officers, Fairbanks hid in a nearby neighborhood. Officers found Fairbanks and exchanged gunfire again, this time killing him. Coon Rapids police Officer Alex Hattstrom and Anoka County sheriff's Deputy Christopher Vitek Jr. both fired their guns, and Coon Rapids police Officer Geoff Neumann reportedly discharged his Taser. \end{scriptsize}

## American Indians / Alaksa Natives are at high risk of being killed by police 

|Sex|Race| Lifetime Deaths per 100,000| Risk ratio |
|---|----|----------------------------------:| ---:|
| M | AI/AN| 59   | 1.5 | 
| M | White | 40 | - |
| F | AI/AN| 4  | 2 |
| F | White | 2 | - |

## Police killings as a function of the political status of tribal nations

- Tribal nations are “domestic dependent” nations – wards of the federal government.
- Law structures colonial state violence through 1) legal history and 2) place-based legal structures

## Theory: Sovereign shields and state violence

- Does tribal sovereignty shield American Indians from state violence?     
     - Police violence (this paper)
     - Arrest and incarceration
     - Family separations through child welfare systems

## Native nationhood and law enforcement

*Historical Encounters with Law Enforcement*

- **1790s-1820s:** Treaties, Trade and Intercourse Period 
-	**1820s-1880s:** Removal and Reservation Period 
-	**1880s-1920s:** Allotment and Assimilation Period 
     - Indian Agents acted on behalf of the U.S. government in Indian Country
     
*Contemporary Encounters with Law Enforcement*

- **1920s-1940s:** Indian New Deal Period 
-	**1940s-1960s:** Termination Period 
     - PL 280, "shared" jurisdiction
- **1960s-Today:** Self-Determination Period 
     - Police act on behalf of federal, state, local, and tribal government in Indian Country

# Findings, data and methods

## Key findings

-	Police killings of American Indians are concentrated in states West of the Mississippi River. \pause
-	There are more killings by police in states where state and local law enforcement have jurisdiction on Indian lands. \pause
-	Killings occur most frequently in states with high levels of Native/White income inequality. \pause
-	Killings occur less frequently on reservations and tribal lands where communities operate their own courts and criminal justice institutions. 

## Data

- Fatal Encounters, 2000 - 2018, victims identified as American Indian / Alaska Native
- Census of Tribal Justice Agencies (CTJA) 2002
- American Community Survey (ACS) 2013 - 2017 5 year
- AFCARS
- CTJA linked to US Census American Indian Home Land shape files

## Measures

- FE: AI/AN Deaths, AI/AN Deaths on tribal land
- CTJA: tribal government has own legal institutions: [police, jail, courts]
- ACS: per capita income for states 
     - American Indian homeland / State ratios of poverty rates, unemployment rates
- PL 280 status: [mandatory, voluntary, non-PL 280]

## Models

State models (state by year 2013 - 2018):

\[deaths \sim Poisson(\lambda) \]
\[log(E[deaths|X]) = \lambda = \beta X + \alpha_{state} + \zeta_{year} + log(pop) \]

American Indian home land models (pooled 2000 - 2018):

\[deaths \sim QuasiPoisson(\lambda, \theta) \]
\[log(E[deaths|X]) = \theta = \beta X + log(pop)\]
\[var(deaths) = \theta \cdot \lambda \]

# Discussion 

##  Next steps

*Theoretical implications*

- Legacies of colonization drive police killings of American Indians 
- Sovereignty may act as a shield \pause

*Next steps*

- Other forms of state violence: arrest, incarceration, family separation \pause
- More sophisticated measures of tribal sovereignty \pause
- 71 percent of AI/AN population is in urban metros \pause
- Do tribal sovereigns have effects beyond their borders?
