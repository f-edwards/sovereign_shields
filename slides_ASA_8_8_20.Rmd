## Settler state violence and tribal sovereignty

- Despite guarantees of sovereignty in policing and child welfare, AIAN people continue to experience high levels of violence from the settler state
- We consider how colonial political relationships structure exposure to various forms of state violence

## State violence and American Indians and Alaska Natives: police

## Native nationhood 

- Tribal governments are 'domestic dependent nations', formally subordinate to the US federal government
- There are 573 federally recognized American Indian nations and Alaska Native tribes within the borders of the US; many more tribal communities are not federally recognized
- Federal recognition generally formalizes rights and jurisdiction over land, people and resources
- Expands the possibility of government-to-government relationships, including resistance to external coercion

## Native nationhood and the law

- Treaties delineated geographic and social relationships between American Indians and settlers
- Treaty making ended in 1871; practices of elimination, removal, and containment have persisted
- A range of federal programs used to manage and contain dispossessed and relocated tribes (e.g. federal law enforcement, boarding schools, land allotment)
- The social space and legal complexity of subrdinated sovereignty and ongoing disposession has created 'jurisdictional mazes' with routine struggles over authority (e.g. *McGirt v. Oklahoma* (2020))

## Law enforcement and social control in Indian Country

- Public Law 280 (1953, amended 1968) transferred jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters from federal to state legal authorities in 6 states (CA, MN, NE, OR, WI, and AK), with others allowed to transfer jurisdiction in full or in part later (AZ, FL, ID, IA, MT, NV, ND, SD, UT, WA). 
- Most tribes did not consent to transfer of jurisdiction, and state policies and practices often constrain tribal public safety efforts
- Federal funds are not attached to transferred jurisdictions, and implementation is inconsistent: leads to particular form of 'distorted responsiveness' (Prowse, Weaver and Meares, 2019)

## Theory: Agents of empire and sovereignty as a shield

- 'Agents of empire' are actors affiliated with the settler state that work to assimilate and regulate AIAN communities: include Indian Agents, federal law enforcement, state and local law enforcement, and welfare and child welfare organizations.
- Tribes can leverage their sovereignty as both legal authority and organizational capacity to shield members from exposure to violence from various agents of empire
- Constrained tribal sovereignty increases the possibility for exposure to settler state violence

## Empirical questions

- Are American Indians more likely to experience state violence in places with more constraints on tribal sovereignty?
- Are American Indians less likely to experience state violence in places with higher levels of tribal sovereignty?

## Data and methods

- Fatal Encounters use of force deaths with Ameican Indian victims in the lower 48 US states 2008 - 2019 (192 deaths)
  - These are conservative counts: AIAN people are likely undercounted in FE
- Census of Tribal Justice Agencies (2002)
- Additional data: ACS; AFCARS

## Discussion

- Police kill American Indians more frequently in places where tribal sovereignty is constrained
- Police violence is political
- Impacts of sovereignty not limited to police violence

## Next Steps

- Develop a new law-review based set of measures of tribal sovereignty for all tribal governments in the lower 48 US states
- Multiple criminal justice sytem measures
- Qualitative case studies of how tribal governments use sovereignty as a protective force
